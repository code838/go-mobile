      "q1": "Why hasn't my withdrawal request been credited immediately?",
      "a1": "Your withdrawal request needs to be reviewed by the backend. After approval, the system will initiate an on-chain transfer. The network confirmation time of different chains will also affect the arrival speed. Generally, USDT-TRC20 can arrive within a few minutes, while ETH/ERC20 networks may take longer. Please be patient.",
      "q2": "Why was my withdrawal request rejected?",
      "a2": "Withdrawal requests may be rejected due to the following reasons: 1. Incorrect withdrawal address format; 2. Withdrawal amount below the minimum withdrawal amount; 3. Insufficient account balance; 4. Account security verification failed. Please check the relevant information and resubmit the application.",
      "q3": "Can I cancel or modify my withdrawal request?",
      "a3": "Once a withdrawal request is submitted, you can contact customer service to cancel it before it is approved. After approval, the order cannot be canceled or modified. It is recommended to carefully check the withdrawal information before submitting.",
      "q4": "How to ensure my account security?",
      "a4": "We recommend that you: 1. Set a strong password and change it regularly; 2. Bind email and mobile phone number; 3. Do not disclose passwords and verification codes to others; 4. Use in a secure network environment. If you find any abnormalities in your account, please contact customer service immediately.",
      "q5": "How long does it take for deposits to arrive?",
      "a5": "The deposit arrival time depends on the confirmation speed of the blockchain network. Generally, USDT-TRC20 network requires 1-3 block confirmations, about 3-6 minutes; ETH/ERC20 network requires 12 block confirmations, about 3-5 minutes. Please be patient.",
      "q6": "What is cloud shopping? How to participate?",
      "a6": "Cloud shopping is an innovative shopping method where users use points or tokens to participate in product lottery. Each product has a fixed number of participants. When the number is full, the system will automatically draw the lottery. Winners can get products at a very low cost.",
      "q7": "How to claim products after winning?",
      "a7": "After winning, the system will display the winning information in the order record of the personal center. You need to fill in the delivery address within the specified time, and we will ship it for you as soon as possible. If you fail to fill in the address on time, it will be deemed as giving up the prize.",
      "q8": "What rewards are there for inviting friends?",
      "a8": "After successfully inviting friends to register and complete real-name authentication, you will get point rewards. You will also get a certain percentage of commission income from the consumption of invited users on the platform. Please check the invitation rules for details.",
      "q9": "How long does it take for deposits to arrive?",
      "a9": "Usually 1-5 minutes.",
      "q10": "What to do if deposit fails or doesn't arrive?",
      "a10": "If it still hasn't arrived, please provide the following information to contact customer service:\n1. Transaction hash (TxID);\n2. Deposit amount and time;\n3. Screenshots of deposit network and address.\n\nIf the deposit fails, please confirm the following information:\n1. Whether the deposit address is correct;\n2. Whether the selected network is consistent;\n3. Whether the blockchain has shown successful transfer (check blockchain explorer).",
      "q11": "Can I use exchange wallets to deposit directly?",
      "a11": "Yes, but it is recommended to use personal wallets for deposits first. Some exchanges may have delays or processing failures. Using personal wallets can better protect asset security.",
      "q12": "Why hasn't my withdrawal request been credited immediately?",
      "a12": "Your withdrawal request needs to be reviewed by the backend. After approval, the system will initiate an on-chain transfer. The network confirmation time of different chains will also affect the arrival speed. Generally, USDT-TRC20 can arrive within a few minutes, while ETH/ERC20 networks may take longer. Please be patient.",
      "q13": "Why was my withdrawal request rejected?",
      "a13": "Common reasons include:\n1. Incorrect withdrawal address or unsupported chain;\n2. Withdrawal amount below minimum withdrawal limit;\n3. Insufficient available balance or frozen funds;\n4. Abnormal behavior triggered risk control.\n\nPlease check if your withdrawal information is correct. If you have any questions, please contact platform customer service.",
      "q14": "Can I cancel or modify my withdrawal request?",
      "a14": "Before backend review, you can contact customer service to cancel the withdrawal request; once approved and on-chain broadcast is completed, withdrawal transactions cannot be withdrawn. Please be sure to confirm that the withdrawal address and amount are correct.",
      "q15": "Why is the amount credited after I exchanged USDT less than what I entered?",
      "a15": "The system charges a certain percentage of exchange fees. Actual credited amount = exchange amount - handling fee. Please check the specific rate on the exchange page.",
      "q16": "Does the exchange operation require backend review?",
      "a16": "No. Exchange is automatically processed by the system. After submitting an exchange request, points or other currencies will be deducted in real time and corresponding USDT will be issued immediately.",
      "q17": "Why did my exchange order fail?",
      "a17": "Possible reasons include:\n1. Insufficient available balance;\n2. Exchange amount below minimum limit or exceeds maximum limit;\n3. Network fluctuations caused price refresh, please initiate exchange again."
