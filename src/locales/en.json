      "q1": "How long does it take for deposits to arrive?",
      "a1": "Usually 1-5 minutes.",
      "q2": "What to do if deposit fails or doesn't arrive?",
      "a2": "If it still hasn't arrived, please provide the following information to contact customer service:\n1. Transaction hash (TxID);\n2. Deposit amount and time;\n3. Screenshots of deposit network and address.\n\nIf the deposit fails, please confirm the following information:\n1. Whether the deposit address is correct;\n2. Whether the selected network is consistent;\n3. Whether the blockchain has shown successful transfer (check blockchain explorer).",
      "q3": "Can I use exchange wallets to deposit directly?",
      "a3": "Yes, but it is recommended to use personal wallets for deposits first. Some exchanges may have delays or processing failures. Using personal wallets can better protect asset security.",
      "q4": "Why hasn't my withdrawal request been credited immediately?",
      "a4": "Your withdrawal request needs to be reviewed by the backend. After approval, the system will initiate an on-chain transfer. The network confirmation time of different chains will also affect the arrival speed. Generally, USDT-TRC20 can arrive within a few minutes, while ETH/ERC20 networks may take longer. Please be patient.",
      "q5": "Why was my withdrawal request rejected?",
      "a5": "Common reasons include:\n1. Incorrect withdrawal address or unsupported chain;\n2. Withdrawal amount below minimum withdrawal limit;\n3. Insufficient available balance or frozen funds;\n4. Abnormal behavior triggered risk control.\n\nPlease check if your withdrawal information is correct. If you have any questions, please contact platform customer service.",
      "q6": "Can I cancel or modify my withdrawal request?",
      "a6": "Before backend review, you can contact customer service to cancel the withdrawal request; once approved and on-chain broadcast is completed, withdrawal transactions cannot be withdrawn. Please be sure to confirm that the withdrawal address and amount are correct.",
      "q7": "Why is the amount credited after I exchanged USDT less than what I entered?",
      "a7": "The system charges a certain percentage of exchange fees. Actual credited amount = exchange amount - handling fee. Please check the specific rate on the exchange page.",
      "q8": "Does the exchange operation require backend review?",
      "a8": "No. Exchange is automatically processed by the system. After submitting an exchange request, points or other currencies will be deducted in real time and corresponding USDT will be issued immediately.",
      "q9": "Why did my exchange order fail?",
      "a9": "Possible reasons include:\n1. Insufficient available balance;\n2. Exchange amount below minimum limit or exceeds maximum limit;\n3. Network fluctuations caused price refresh, please initiate exchange again."
